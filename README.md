The Face Recognition Attendance System is an automated solution for tracking attendance using facial recognition technology. Built with Python, OpenCV, and the Haar Cascade
Classifier for frontal face detection, the system captures an image of each individual as they face the camera. When a face is detected, it is compared with existing records 
to identify the person. Upon successful recognition, the system records the individualâ€™s attendance in an Excel sheet with the date and time of entry. This efficient and 
user-friendly tool minimizes manual effort, enhances security, and ensures accurate, real-time attendance tracking for institutions or workplaces.
